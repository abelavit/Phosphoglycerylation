# Phosphoglycerylation

This repository contains extracted data from the 91 protein sequences. A total of 3360 lysine residues were retrieved. The data comprises protein sequence name, feature vector, label (whether phosphoglycerylated for not) and the location of lysine in the protein sequence.
Feature vector is of 120 dimension pertaining to accessible surface area, amino acid contribution to local structure conformations and backbone torsion angles of seven amino acids downstream and upstream of lysine and lysine itself.
